Welcome to the first international workshop on DevOps co-located with MODELS!

In the context of software development, DevOps focuses on optimizing the flow of activities involved in the creation of end user value, from idea to deployed functionality and operating systems. It includes different software development paradigms and techniques such as continuous integration or deployment, runtime monitoring, analytics, or self-adaptation of systems. Classicaly, these paradigms are implemented in a handmade way by DevOps engineers, and there is no formal support to validate the defined environment, even if they are critical in the product life-cycle.

Model-based engineering (MDE) aims at increasing productivity and systems quality through the use of models that are understandable and actionable.  

For the modeling community, this poses the following fundamental questions: Can modeling and MDE contribute to DevOps, or is modeling fundamentally in contradiction with the goals of agile and DevOps? And, conversely, given the important role of model-driven engineering in the conception and development of complex systems, can DevOps help in the continuous integration and evolution of modeling artifacts themselves?

In this workshop, we are interested in the different aspects of DevOps and modelling, more specifically the relationship that exists between modelling and DevOps, and its opposite between DevOps and modelling. In addition to research contributions, we are also interested in contributions related to the teaching of such topics.
