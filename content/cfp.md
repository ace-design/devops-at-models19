# Call for Participation

In the context of software development, DevOps focuses on optimizing the flow of activities involved in the creation of end user value, from idea to deployed functionality and operating systems. It includes different software development paradigms and techniques such as continuous integration or deployment, runtime monitoring, analytics, or self-adaptation of systems. Classicaly, these paradigms are implemented in a handmade way by DevOps engineers, and there is no formal support to validate the defined environment, even if they are critical in the product life-cycle.

_Model-based engineering_ (MDE) aims at increasing productivity and systems quality through the use of models that are understandable and actionable.  The MDE approach relies on pillars such as dedicated languages definition, formal model reasoning or code generation, which are classically opposed to lightweight approaches defended by the software craftsmanship community.

For the modeling community, this poses the following fundamental questions: Can modeling and MDE contribute to DevOps, or is modeling fundamentally in contradiction with the goals of agile and DevOps? And, conversely, given the important role of model-driven engineering in the conception and development of complex systems, can DevOps help in the continuous integration and evolution of modeling artifacts themselves?


## Topic of interests

We are interested in the different aspects of DevOps and modelling, more specifically the relationship that exists between modelling and DevOps, and its opposite between DevOps and modelling. In addition to research contributions, we are also interested in contributions related to the teaching of such topics. The workshops has the ambition to cover the following questions:


  - Modelling for DevOps:
    - Modelling can easily be linked to "dev", what is its relationship to "ops"?
    - What aspects of DevOps can modeling contribute to?
    - What is the role of modelling in DevOps?
    - What concrete solution (_e.g._, method, process, tool) can modelling brings to DevOps?
    - What kind of analysis or reasoning techniques are needed by the DevOps approach?
    - How can modelling helps to improve DevOps best practices?

  - DevOps for Modelling:
    - How to monitor a model-driven software in an "ops" context?
    - How can DevOps help in achieving a kind of continuous model-driven engineering process?
    - Are classical MDE tools and techniques ready for DevOps? Can we combine these tools with existing ones?
    - How can DevOps be used to ease the adoption of MDE tools and techniques?
    - What are the requirements for a model-driven tool to be DevOps compatible?
    - What would be the benefits of considering model-driven development in a DevOps way?

## Submissions


  1. **Research papers** (6 and 10 pages): describe new and innovative ways how modeling can contribute to DevOps; papers addressing relevant challenges, trends, and opportunities (see "Topics of Interest") are particularly encouraged.
  2. **Experience report** in the combined use of modeling and DevOps (6 and 10 pages): Clearly describe the application domain and context, the DevOps aspect and problem addressed, the modeling technique and tools used, and the results of the use of modeling.
  3. **Position papers** (4 and 6 pages): Clearly describe a position or opinion on a relevant topic (see "Topics of Interest") in an insightful way; papers discussing challenges to the development of model-based solutions for DevOps and supporting documentation and how they could be mitigated or removed are particularly encouraged.
  4. **Industrial contributions** (extended abstract of 2 to 4 pages): Industrial people interested in contributing to the workshop can submit an extended abstract describing their current usage or challenges regarding the combined usage of modeling and DevOps. The extended abstract must clearly describe the application domain and context, and the DevOps aspect and problem addressed.   

All submitted artifacts must use English. All textual documents must adhere to the Models conference formatting guidelines.
