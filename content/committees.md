**Francis Bordeleau** is professor at _École de Technologie Supérieure_ (ETS) in Montréal. He is currently working on establishing of an industry research chair, which includes the development on new course, on DevOps. He has over 25 years of experience in software and model-based engineering (MBE); researching, working, consulting, and collaborating with companies worldwide. Prior to joining ETS, he was the founder of Cmind (2017-), product manager of SW Development at Ericsson (2013-2017), founder and CEO of Zeligsoft (2003-2013), director of Tooling Business for PrismTech (2010-2013), and assistant professor at Carleton University (1997-2006). Francis has been part of the organizing and program committee of many international conferences and workshops, including MODELS,ICSE, ECMFA, MDETools, PAINS, OSS4MDE, and MiSE.

**Jean-Michel Bruel** is professor at University of Toulouse and is head of the SM@RT team of the IRIT CNRS laboratory. His research areas include development of software intensive Cyber-Physical Systems, methods/model/language integration, with a main focus on Requirements and Model-Based Systems Engineering. He designed an undergraduate course dedicated to Continuous Integration at Université de Toulouse. Jean-Michel has been part of the organizing and program committee of many international conferences and workshops, including MODELS, ECMFA, MDETools, OSS4MDE, and DevOps.

**Jordi Cabot** is an ICREA Research Professor at Internet Interdisciplinary Institute, the research center of the Open University of Catalonia. He is a previous models PC Chair and current Steering Committee Chair. Within Models he has also organized many times the well-known OCL Workshop and played a number of other organizational roles. His research interests include how modeling can be a first-class citizen in any CI process.


**Juergen Dingel** is Professor in the School of Computing at Queen's University.  His research is centered around the development and use of informal and formal techniques for the analysis of software artifacts.  Juergen was co-organizer of the following MODELS  workshops: MDETools'17, OSS4MDE'14-'16, AMT'12-'15, and MASE'15, the Workshop on Software Modeling for Embedded and Sensor Network Systems at CASCON'11, PC co-chair of the FMOODS/FORTE'11 conference and the DEBS'05 workshop, Workshop co-chair for MODELS'10, and Chair of the Doctoral Symposium at MODELS'09.  In 2014, he served as PC chair of the Foundations Track of MODELS'14.

**Sébastien Mosser** is Professor of Software Engineering at _Université du Québec à Montréal_ (UQAM). His  research  interests  cover  software  development  and  separation  of  concerns mechanisms,  with  a  particular  focus  on  domain-specific  languages,  model-driven engineering and software composition. He designed a graduate course dedicated to DevOps & Software Architecture at Université Côte d'Azur. Sébastien has been part of the organization and program committees of several conferences and workshops related to model-driven engineering and software development, including industrial events.
